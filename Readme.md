List implementation in Rust
===========================
This is a proof of concept implementation of List for educational purposes and is not intended for production use. Yet.
This project is being used as a training exercise to learn the Rust language and to solicit peer review to help improve and clarify the concepts.
I remember using a similar implementation of List when learning Scala and found it to be very helpful in expanding on certain concepts.
